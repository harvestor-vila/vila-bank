part 2:
 (A) A pie chart with distinct colors representing each age group and labeled slices showing the percentage of the total population.
(B) A line graph with age groups on the x-axis and population on the y-axis, connected by a line to show population trends.
(C) A scatter plot with age groups on the x-axis and population on the y-axis, with each age group represented by a single point.
(D) A 3D bar chart with multiple bars for each age group to show different demographic variables in addition to population.
