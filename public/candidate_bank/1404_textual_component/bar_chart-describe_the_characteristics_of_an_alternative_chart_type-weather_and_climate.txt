    part 2: 
    (A) The box plot would show individual data points for each city, with lines connecting the points in ascending order of temperature.
    (B) The box plot would display the distribution of temperatures across cities, with a box representing the interquartile range and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values.
    (C) The box plot would consist of 20 separate boxes, each representing the average temperature of a city, without any indication of variability or distribution.
    (D) The box plot would have a single box representing the combined average temperature of all cities, with no differentiation between individual cities.
    part 3: (B) The box plot would display the distribution of temperatures across cities, with a box representing the interquartile range and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values.
