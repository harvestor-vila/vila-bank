part 1: The visualization above is only a demonstration of the relevant data. Which visualization design would be most appropriate for understanding the distribution of daily average temperatures?
part 2:
 (A) A pie chart showing the proportion of days within specific temperature ranges.
(B) A scatter plot with each day's temperature plotted against the sequence of days.
(C) A histogram with appropriate bin widths to show the frequency distribution of temperatures.
(D) A line graph showing temperature trends over the sequence of days.
