part 1: If the energy production data were to be displayed using a pie chart instead of a bar chart, which of the following would be a characteristic of the pie chart?
    part 2: 
    (A) Each energy source would be represented by a slice, with the slice size proportional to the production value.
    (B) Energy sources with higher production would be represented by darker shades, while those with lower production would be lighter.
    (C) The pie chart would display energy sources on the x-axis and production values on the y-axis.
    (D) The pie chart would use varying bar heights to represent the production values of each energy source.
    part 3: (A) Each energy source would be represented by a slice, with the slice size proportional to the production value.
