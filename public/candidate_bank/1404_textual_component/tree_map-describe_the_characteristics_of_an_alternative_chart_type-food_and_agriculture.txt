    (C) The pie chart would show slices of varying sizes, each representing a subcategory, with the size of each slice proportional to the percentage value of that subcategory.
    (D) The pie chart would be divided into three large slices, one for each main category, with no distinction between the subcategories.
    part 3: (C) The pie chart would show slices of varying sizes, each representing a subcategory, with the size of each slice proportional to the percentage value of that subcategory.
