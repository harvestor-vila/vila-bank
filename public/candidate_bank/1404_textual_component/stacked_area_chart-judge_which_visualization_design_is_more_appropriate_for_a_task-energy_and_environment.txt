part 1: The visualization above is only a demonstration of the relevant data. Which of the following visualization designs would be most appropriate to compare the cumulative energy production from different sources over the entire time period?
part 2:
(A) A pie chart showing the proportion of each energy source's production for a single year.
(B) A stacked area chart showing the cumulative energy production from different sources over time.
(C) A line chart with multiple lines, each representing the yearly energy production of a different source.
(D) A scatter plot with points representing the energy production of each source for each year.
part 3: (B) A stacked area chart showing the cumulative energy production from different sources over time.
