part 2:
(A) A pie chart with slices representing different ranges of population sizes and their corresponding median ages.
(B) A scatterplot with population size on the x-axis and median age on the y-axis, each point representing a different data point.
(C) A bar chart with bars representing different ranges of median ages and their corresponding population sizes.
(D) A line graph with population size on the x-axis and median age on the y-axis, with a line connecting points in order of increasing population size.

part 3:   (B) A scatterplot with population size on the x-axis and median age on the y-axis, each point representing a different data point.
