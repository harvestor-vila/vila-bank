part 2:
(A) A pie chart showing the percentage of individuals within predefined income ranges.
(B) A scatter plot with individual income values on the y-axis and a random spread on the x-axis to avoid overlap.
(C) A box plot indicating the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the income distribution.
(D) A line graph showing the trend of income change over time with income on the y-axis and individual index on the x-axis.
