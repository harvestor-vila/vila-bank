expert_3,tree_map-identify_range-energy_and_environment,Yes,Very challenging to compare the areas,hard to identify range in tree map because size is hard,"q4: no

expert_6,tree_map-identify_range-energy_and_environment,Yes,"Not as clear in this one what values are being encoded, so it seems like there could be more uncertainty or confusion related to the visualization question/items.",,
expert_7,tree_map-identify_range-energy_and_environment,No,Cannot read any values from the visualization,,
expert_8,tree_map-identify_range-energy_and_environment,No,Not sure what the tree map represents or what the ranges are in the options,,
author1,tree_map-identify_range-energy_and_environment,Yes,a bit hard to estimate ,,

expert_8,tree_map-judge_which_visualization_design_is_more_appropriate_for_a_task-weather_and_climate,No,I'm familiar with the climate domain but I have trouble imagining a scenario where we need to compare the proportion of temperature data vs. precipitation data (part of what a treemap does),,
expert_10,tree_map-judge_which_visualization_design_is_more_appropriate_for_a_task-weather_and_climate,Yes,The chart in this question feels like it's doing a lot of leading... maybe show all 4 alternatives?,,
author1,tree_map-judge_which_visualization_design_is_more_appropriate_for_a_task-weather_and_climate,Yes,map is weird because temp prep and wind are not the same hierarchy ,,

expert_1,tree_map-make_comparisons-energy_and_environment,Yes,It's hard to compare when values are relatively close to each other. ,"hard to compare size in tree map
