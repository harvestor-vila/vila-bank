part 1: What is the ratio of the population of Boravia to that of Deltora?

part 2: 
  (A) 3.1
  (B) 5.3
  (C) 6.3
  (D) 7.7

part 3: (C) 6.3

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the population values from the dataset: Boravia's population is 19,000,000 and Deltora's population is 3,000,000. The ratio is 19,000,000 / 3,000,000 = 6.333...

2. The precise correct answer is then rounded to one decimal place: 6.333... rounds to 6.3.

3. Calculate what 15% multiplies the rounded correct answer is: 15% of 6.3 is 0.945, which rounds up to the nearest whole number, 1.

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least 1 unit away from the rounded correct answer: 6.3 - 1 = 5.3, 6.3 + 1 = 7.3 (rounded to 7.3), and adding another unit to get 8.3 (rounded to 8.3). However, to ensure the incorrect options are unambiguously incorrect and at least min_distance away, I adjusted them to be 3.1, 5.3, and 7.7, which are all more than 1 unit away from the correct answer.
