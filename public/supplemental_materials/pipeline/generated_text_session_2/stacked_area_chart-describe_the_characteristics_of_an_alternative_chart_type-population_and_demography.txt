part 1: If the population distribution by age group over time were to be displayed using a line chart instead of a stacked area chart, which of the following would be an accurate description of the line chart's characteristics?

part 2: 
(A) Each age group would be represented by a line that overlaps with others, making it difficult to discern individual trends.
(B) The line chart would show cumulative population totals for each year with lines stacked on top of one another.
(C) The line chart would display separate, non-overlapping lines for each age group, allowing for comparison of trends over time.
(D) The line chart would use shading between lines to represent the proportion of each age group within the total population for each year.

part 3: (C) The line chart would display separate, non-overlapping lines for each age group, allowing for comparison of trends over time.
