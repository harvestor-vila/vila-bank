part 1: Estimate the difference in the number of votes between the Communist and Socialist parties.

part 2: 
(A) 500 votes
(B) 616 votes
(C) 730 votes
(D) 850 votes

part 3: (B) 616 votes

To explain the process:

1. Calculate the precise correct answer:
   Difference between Communist and Socialist votes = 9433 (Communist) - 8817 (Socialist) = 616

2. Round the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
   616 rounds to 616.0 (no change as there are no decimal places).

3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of 616 = 92.4, which rounds up to 93 (min_distance).

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   (A) 500 (116 away from 616)
   (C) 730 (114 away from 616)
   (D) 850 (234 away from 616)

These options ensure that each incorrect option is at least 93 votes away from the correct answer, fulfilling the requirement for min_distance.
