part 1: What is the ratio of Cholesterol Level for Patient 2 to that of Patient 4?

part 2: 
(A) 0.8
(B) 1.2
(C) 1.6
(D) 2.4

part 3: (B) 1.2

To explain the process:

1. From the dataset, we find the Cholesterol Level for Patient 2 is 286 and for Patient 4 is 230.
2. The precise correct answer is the ratio of Cholesterol Level for Patient 2 to that of Patient 4: 286 / 230 â‰ˆ 1.2435.
3. The rounded correct answer to one decimal place is 1.2.
4. 15% of the rounded correct answer is 0.18, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 1 (min_distance).
5. The three incorrect options are generated to be at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 0.8 is 0.4 away from 1.2.
   - Option (C) 1.6 is 0.4 away from 1.2.
   - Option (D) 2.4 is 1.2 away from 1.2.
