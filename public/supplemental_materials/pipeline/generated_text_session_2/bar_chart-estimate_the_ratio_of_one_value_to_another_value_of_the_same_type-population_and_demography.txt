part 1: What is the ratio of the population in the 45-64 age group to the population in the 25-44 age group?

part 2: 
  (A) 0.5
  (B) 0.3
  (C) 0.7
  (D) 2.1

part 3: (A) 0.5

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the population values from the dataset for the 45-64 age group (1525) and the 25-44 age group (3226), which is 1525 / 3226 â‰ˆ 0.4726.

2. The precise correct answer is then rounded to one decimal place, which gives us 0.5.

3. To find min_distance, we calculate 15% of the rounded correct answer: 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075. When rounded up to the nearest whole number, min_distance is 1.

4. Three incorrect options are generated that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer of 0.5. These are:
   - Option (B) 0.3 (0.5 - 1 * min_distance)
   - Option (C) 0.7 (0.5 + 1 * min_distance)
   - Option (D) 2.1 (0.5 + 3 * min_distance, ensuring it is more than min_distance away)
