part 1: If the 100 percent stacked bar chart showing the energy source distribution over years were to be converted into a pie chart for the year 2021, which of the following descriptions would be accurate?

part 2: 
(A) Each slice of the pie chart would represent a different year, with the size of each slice proportional to the total number of energy sources in that year.
(B) The pie chart would consist of five slices, each representing an energy source's contribution to the total energy mix, with the "Fossil Fuels" slice being the largest.
(C) The pie chart would show a single slice representing the "Nuclear" energy source, as it is the only source used in 2021.
(D) The pie chart would have five slices, corresponding to each energy source, with the "Solar" slice being the largest, followed by "Hydro" and "Nuclear" with smaller but similar-sized slices, and "Wind" and "Fossil Fuels" having the smallest slices.
