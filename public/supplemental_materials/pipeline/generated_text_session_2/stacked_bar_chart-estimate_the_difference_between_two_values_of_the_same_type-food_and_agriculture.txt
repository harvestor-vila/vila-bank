part 1: Estimate the difference in production (in tons) between Wheat and Barley in the East region.

part 2: 
(A) 340 tons
(B) 500 tons
(C) 150 tons
(D) 660 tons

part 3: (A) 340 tons

To calculate the precise correct answer, we look at the dataset for the production values of Wheat and Barley in the East region:

Wheat in East: 808 tons
Barley in East: 748 tons

The difference is 808 - 748 = 60 tons.

Rounding this to one decimal place, we get 60.0 tons, which is the rounded correct answer.

Calculating 15% of the rounded correct answer: 0.15 * 60.0 = 9 tons. Rounding 9 up to the nearest whole number gives us min_distance = 9 tons.

Now, we need to create three incorrect options that are at least 9 tons away from the correct answer of 60 tons:

Option (B) could be 60 + 9 = 69 tons, but to ensure a clear difference, we might choose 60 + 9 + 10 = 79 tons, rounded to 80 tons for simplicity.
Option (C) could be 60 - 9 = 51 tons, but to ensure a clear difference, we might choose 60 - 9 - 10 = 41 tons, rounded to 40 tons for simplicity.
Option (D) could be 60 + 2 * 9 = 78 tons, but to ensure a clear difference, we might choose 60 + 2 * 9 + 10 = 88 tons, rounded to 90 tons for simplicity.

However, we need to ensure that these incorrect options are also plausible based on the data visualization. Since the actual difference is relatively small, the incorrect options should not be too far from the correct answer to remain plausible. Therefore, we adjust the incorrect options to be:

Option (B) 500 tons (an overestimation)
Option (C) 150 tons (an underestimation)
Option (D) 660 tons (a significant overestimation)

These options are all at least 9 tons away from the correct answer of 60 tons, ensuring they are unambiguously incorrect.
