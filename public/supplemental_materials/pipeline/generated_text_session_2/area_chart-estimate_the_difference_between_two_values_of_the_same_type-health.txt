part 1: Estimate the difference in the number of patients recovered between Day 10 and Day 15.

part 2: 
  (A) 40
  (B) 60
  (C) 80
  (D) 100

part 3: (B) 60

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset provided:
   PatientsRecovered on Day 15 - PatientsRecovered on Day 10 = 159 - 99 = 60

2. The precise correct answer is already a whole number, so the rounded correct answer is 60.

3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number to get min_distance:
   15% of 60 = 9, rounded up to the nearest whole number is 9.

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   (A) 60 - 9 * 2 = 42 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 40)
   (C) 60 + 9 * 2 = 78 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 80)
   (D) 60 + 9 * 4 = 96 (rounded to the nearest whole number, 100)

Option (B) is the correct answer, and options (A), (C), and (D) are the incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the correct answer.
