part 1: If the scatterplot of Temperature vs Humidity were to be represented as a box plot, which of the following characteristics would it display?

part 2: 
(A) The box plot would show a single box for each variable with a clear indication of the median, quartiles, and potential outliers for temperature and humidity separately.
(B) The box plot would display the distribution of data points along a timeline, with temperature and humidity values stacked on top of each other.
(C) The box plot would illustrate the exact positive correlation between temperature and humidity with a line of best fit.
(D) The box plot would consist of concentric circles representing temperature and humidity, with the size of each circle corresponding to the frequency of data points.

part 3: (A) The box plot would show a single box for each variable with a clear indication of the median, quartiles, and potential outliers for temperature and humidity separately.
