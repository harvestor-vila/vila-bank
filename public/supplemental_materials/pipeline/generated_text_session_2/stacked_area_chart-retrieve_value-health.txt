part 1: What was the number of Neurological cases reported in the year 2010?

part 2: 
(A) 239
(B) 339
(C) 439
(D) 539

part 3: (B) 339

To explain the process:
- The correct answer is taken directly from the dataset: 339 Neurological cases in 2010.
- Calculating 15% of 339 gives us 50.85, which we round up to the nearest whole number, 51 (min_distance).
- The three incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting multiples of the min_distance from the correct answer, ensuring that each incorrect option is at least min_distance away from the correct answer.
