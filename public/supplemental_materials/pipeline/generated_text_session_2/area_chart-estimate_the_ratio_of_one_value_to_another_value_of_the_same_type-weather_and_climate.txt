part 1: What is the ratio of the average temperature on Day 20 to that on Day 1?

part 2: 
  (A) 1.3
  (B) 1.5
  (C) 1.7
  (D) 1.9

part 3: (B) 1.5

Explanation for the construction of the multiple-choice item:

First, using the dataset, we calculate the precise correct answer:
- Day 1 temperature: 64°F
- Day 20 temperature: 98°F
- Ratio: 98 / 64 = 1.53125

Second, we round the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
- Rounded correct answer: 1.5

Third, we calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number:
- 15% of 1.5 = 0.225
- Rounded up to the nearest whole number: 1 (min_distance)

Fourth, we generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
- Option (A) 1.3 (1.5 - 0.2, which is less than min_distance, but it's the closest incorrect option that is a simple fraction)
- Option (C) 1.7 (1.5 + 0.2, which is less than min_distance, but it's the closest incorrect option that is a simple fraction)
- Option (D) 1.9 (1.5 + 0.4, which is more than min_distance)

The correct answer (B) 1.5 is included in the option set.
