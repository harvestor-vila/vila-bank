part 1: How many patients are there in the "Strength" category at "Clinic 4"?

part 2: 
  (A) 50
  (B) 148
  (C) 250
  (D) 300

part 3: (B) 148

To generate the incorrect options, I used the correct answer of 148 patients and calculated 15% of this number, which is 22.2. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number gives a min_distance of 23. I then chose three numbers that are at least 23 away from the correct answer: 50 (98 away), 250 (102 away), and 300 (152 away).
