part 1: What is the ratio of the percentage contribution of the Technology sector to the Economy in 2019 compared to its contribution in 2021?

part 2: 
  (A) 0.3
  (B) 9.3
  (C) 6.5
  (D) 2.1

part 3: (B) 9.3

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset:
   - Technology sector contribution in 2019: 28%
   - Technology sector contribution in 2021: 3%
   - Ratio: 28 / 3 = 9.333...

2. The precise correct answer is rounded to one decimal place:
   - Rounded correct answer: 9.3

3. Calculate what 15% multiplies the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number to get min_distance:
   - 15% of 9.3 = 1.395
   - Rounded up to the nearest whole number: 2

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 0.3 (9.3 - 2 * 5)
   - Option (C) 6.5 (9.3 - 2 * 2)
   - Option (D) 2.1 (9.3 - 2 * 4)
