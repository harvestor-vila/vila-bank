part 1: What is the ratio of the education value for California to that of Texas?

part 2: 
(A) 0.8
(B) 1.3
(C) 2.5
(D) 1.8

part 3: (B) 1.3

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the values for California (294) and Texas (234) from the dataset: 294 / 234 = 1.2564...
2. The precise correct answer is rounded to one decimal place: 1.3
3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is: 0.15 * 1.3 = 0.195, rounded up to the nearest whole number is 1 (min_distance).
4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 0.8 (1.3 - 0.5 = 0.8, which is more than min_distance away)
   - Option (C) 2.5 (1.3 + 1.2 = 2.5, which is more than min_distance away)
   - Option (D) 1.8 (1.3 + 0.5 = 1.8, which is more than min_distance away)
