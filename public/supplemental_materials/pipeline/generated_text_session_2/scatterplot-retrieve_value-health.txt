part 1: What is the height in cm of an individual weighing 85 kg?

part 2: 
(A) 95 cm
(B) 117 cm
(C) 140 cm
(D) 160 cm

part 3: (B) 117 cm

To create the incorrect options, I used the correct answer of 117 cm and calculated 15% of this value, which is 17.55. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number gives a min_distance of 18. The incorrect options are then at least 18 units away from the correct answer of 117 cm.
