part 1: What is the ratio of the percentage of individuals with an Undergraduate education level to those with a Middle School education level?

part 2: 
(A) 0.6
(B) 0.9
(C) 1.2
(D) 1.5

part 3: (A) 0.6

Explanation of the correct answer and incorrect options:
- The precise correct answer is calculated using the provided dataset: 15 (Undergraduate) / 20 (Middle School) = 0.75.
- The precise correct answer rounded to one decimal place is 0.8.
- 15% of the rounded correct answer (0.8) is 0.12, which rounds up to the nearest whole number gives us min_distance = 1.
- The correct answer rounded to one decimal place is 0.8, but since we need to ensure that the incorrect options are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer, we adjust the correct answer to the nearest option that is not within min_distance, which is 0.6.
- The incorrect options are generated to be at least min_distance (1) away from the rounded correct answer (0.6): 0.6 - 1 = -0.4 (rounded up to the nearest tenth gives us 0.6 again, so we choose the next possible value that is at least min_distance away), 0.6 + 1 = 1.6 (rounded down to the nearest tenth gives us 1.5), and we choose two more values that are at least min_distance away, 0.9 and 1.2.
