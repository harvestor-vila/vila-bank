  part 2: 
  (A) X1.X (rounded_correct_answer - min_distance)
  (B) X2.X (rounded_correct_answer + min_distance)
  (C) X3.X (another incorrect option at least min_distance away)
  (D) X.X (rounded_correct_answer)
  
  part 3: (D) X.X

Please note that `X1.X`, `X2.X`, `X3.X`, and `X.X` are placeholders for the actual values calculated from the dataset. Once the precise correct answer is calculated, the actual values for the options can be filled in accordingly.
