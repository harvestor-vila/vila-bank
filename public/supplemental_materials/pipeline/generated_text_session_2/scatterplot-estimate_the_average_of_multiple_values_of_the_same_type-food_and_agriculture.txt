part 1: Estimate the average fertilizer use (kg/ha) from the scatterplot showing the relationship between crop yield and fertilizer use.

part 2:
(A) option 1
(B) option 2
(C) option 3
(D) option 4

part 3: the correct answer

Since I do not have the capability to execute R code and perform the actual calculations, I will provide a hypothetical example based on the procedure described:

Let's assume the calculated average fertilizer use is 600 kg/ha, and after rounding, we get a rounded correct answer of 600.0 kg/ha. If `min_distance` is calculated to be 90 kg/ha, the incorrect options would be at least 90 kg/ha away from 600.0 kg/ha.

part 1: Estimate the average fertilizer use (kg/ha) from the scatterplot showing the relationship between crop yield and fertilizer use.

part 2:
(A) 510 kg/ha
(B) 600 kg/ha
(C) 690 kg/ha
(D) 800 kg/ha

part 3: (B) 600 kg/ha

Please note that the actual values for the options will depend on the real calculations based on the dataset provided.
