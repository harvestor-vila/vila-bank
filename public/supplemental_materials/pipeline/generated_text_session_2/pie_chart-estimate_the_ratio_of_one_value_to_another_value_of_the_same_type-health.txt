part 1: What is the ratio of the percentage of people who prioritize Exercise to those who prioritize Diet?

part 2: 
  (A) 1.0
  (B) 1.5
  (C) 0.8
  (D) 2.2

part 3: (C) 0.8

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset values for "Exercise" (30%) and "Diet" (25%): 30 / 25 = 1.2.
2. The precise correct answer is rounded to one decimal place: 1.2 rounds to 1.2.
3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number: 15% of 1.2 is 0.18, which rounds up to 1 (min_distance).
4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 1.0 is 0.2 away from the correct answer, which is less than min_distance.
   - Option (B) 1.5 is 0.3 away from the correct answer, which is more than min_distance.
   - Option (C) 0.8 is the correct answer.
   - Option (D) 2.2 is 1.0 away from the correct answer, which is more than min_distance.

The correct answer (C) 0.8 is included in part 2, and the three incorrect options are at least min_distance away from the correct answer.
