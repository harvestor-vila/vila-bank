part 1: Estimate the difference in Innovation Score between the years 2000 and 2019.

part 2: 
  (A) 700
  (B) 823
  (C) 900
  (D) 1000

part 3: (B) 823

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is the difference between the Innovation Scores of the years 2000 and 2019, which is 961 - 138 = 823.
2. The rounded correct answer is 823.0 (no change needed as it is already at one decimal place).
3. 15% of the rounded correct answer is 0.15 * 823.0 = 123.45, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 124 (min_distance).
4. The incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting the min_distance from the rounded correct answer and ensuring that they are at least min_distance away:
   - Option (A) 700 is more than min_distance away from 823 downwards.
   - Option (C) 900 is more than min_distance away from 823 upwards.
   - Option (D) 1000 is also more than min_distance away from 823 upwards.
