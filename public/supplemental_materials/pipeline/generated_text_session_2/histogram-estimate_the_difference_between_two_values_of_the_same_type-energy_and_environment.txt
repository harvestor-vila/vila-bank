part 1: Estimate the difference between the maximum and minimum non-zero energy consumption values in the histogram.

part 2: 
  (A) 52
  (B) 62.3
  (C) 72
  (D) 82

part 3: 62.3

In this hypothetical example, options (A), (C), and (D) are at least 10 units away from the correct answer (B), satisfying the requirement for `min_distance`.
