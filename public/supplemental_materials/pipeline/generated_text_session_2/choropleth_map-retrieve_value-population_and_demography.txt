(D) 3000000

part 3: (C) 5191993

To clarify the process used to generate the options:
- The correct answer is the population of California: 5191993.
- 15% of 5191993 is 778798.95, which when rounded up to the nearest whole number is 778799.
- The minimum distance (min_distance) is 778799.
- The incorrect options were chosen to be at least min_distance away from the correct answer:
  (A) 5191993 - min_distance = 4414194 (rounded to 4414694 for option A)
  (B) 5191993 + min_distance = 5970792 (rounded to 6000000 for option B)
  (D) 5191993 - 2 * min_distance = 3633395 (rounded to 3000000 for option D)
