part 1: What is the value for Sunshine in CityE?

part 2: 
(A) 35
(B) 51
(C) 85
(D) 120

part 3: (B) 51

To explain the process:
- The correct answer is taken directly from the dataset, which is 51 for Sunshine in CityE.
- Calculating 15% of 51 gives us 7.65, which when rounded up to the nearest whole number is 8 (min_distance).
- The three incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting at least min_distance from the correct answer, ensuring that each incorrect option is at least 8 units away from 51. The options provided are 35 (51 - 16), 85 (51 + 34), and 120 (51 + 69), all of which are more than 8 units away from the correct answer.
