(B) The box plot would display a left-skewed distribution with the median closer to the upper quartile and longer lower whisker.
(C) The box plot would show a right-skewed distribution with the median closer to the lower quartile and a longer upper whisker.
(D) The box plot would have multiple outliers on both the lower and upper ends, indicating a bimodal distribution.
