part 1: What is the difference in production (GWh) between Nuclear and Natural Gas energy sources?

part 2: 
  (A) 5 GWh
  (B) 12 GWh
  (C) 7 GWh
  (D) 20 GWh

part 3: (C) 7 GWh

Calculation for the correct answer and incorrect options:
- Precise correct answer: Difference between Nuclear and Natural Gas = |405 - 398| = 7
- Rounded correct answer: 7.0 (no change as it is already at one decimal place)
- Min_distance: 15% of 7.0 = 1.05, rounded up to the nearest whole number = 2
- Incorrect options generated using min_distance (at least 2 away from 7):
  (A) 5 (7 - 2 = 5)
  (B) 12 (7 + 5 = 12, where 5 is more than min_distance)
  (D) 20 (7 + 13 = 20, where 13 is more than min_distance)
