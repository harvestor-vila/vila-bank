(B) [38, 107]
(C) [50, 90]
(D) [45, 101]

part 3: (C) [50, 90]

Explanation of incorrect options:
- Option (A) is incorrect because 42 is 8 less than 50 (distance_min smaller than min_value), and 104 is 14 more than 90 (distance_max larger than max_value).
- Option (B) is incorrect because 38 is more than 8 less than 50, and 107 is more than 14 more than 90.
- Option (D) is incorrect because 45 is less than 8 less than 50, and 101 is more than 14 more than 90.
