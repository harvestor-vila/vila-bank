part 1: What is the carbon emission value (in metric tons) for an energy consumption of 405 MWh?

part 2: 
(A) 476
(B) 300
(C) 650
(D) 800

part 3: (A) 476

To clarify the process:
- The correct answer is taken directly from the dataset, where the carbon emission value for an energy consumption of 405 MWh is 476 metric tons.
- The min_distance is calculated as 15% of the correct answer, which is 71.4, and rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 72.
- The incorrect options (B), (C), and (D) are generated to be at least 72 units away from the correct answer, ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect.
