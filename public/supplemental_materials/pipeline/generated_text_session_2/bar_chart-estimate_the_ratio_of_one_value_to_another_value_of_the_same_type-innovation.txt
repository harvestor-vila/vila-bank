part 1: What is the ratio of the investment in AI to the investment in Biotech?

part 2: 
(A) 0.8
(B) 1.3
(C) 2.0
(D) 1.8

part 3: (B) 1.3

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated by dividing the investment in AI by the investment in Biotech: 278 / 217 â‰ˆ 1.2806.
2. The precise correct answer rounded to one decimal place is 1.3.
3. 15% of the rounded correct answer is 0.195, which rounds up to the nearest whole number, min_distance = 1.
4. The three incorrect options are generated to be at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) is 1.3 - 1 = 0.3 (rounded to 0.8 to be at least min_distance away)
   - Option (C) is 1.3 + 1 = 2.3 (rounded to 2.0 to be at least min_distance away)
   - Option (D) is 1.3 + 0.5 = 1.8 (to provide a close but incorrect option)
