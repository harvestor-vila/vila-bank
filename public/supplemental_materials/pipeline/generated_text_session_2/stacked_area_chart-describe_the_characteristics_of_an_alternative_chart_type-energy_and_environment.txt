part 1: How would a line chart represent the energy production data by source over time?

part 2: 
(A) A line chart would display each energy source as a separate bar, with bar height representing production values for each year.
(B) A line chart would show a cumulative curve for each energy source, with the area under the curve filled with different colors.
(C) A line chart would depict each energy source as a distinct line, with points plotted for each year's production value and connected by lines.
(D) A line chart would use pie slices to represent the proportion of each energy source's production for individual years.

part 3: (C) A line chart would depict each energy source as a distinct line, with points plotted for each year's production value and connected by lines.
