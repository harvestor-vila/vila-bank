part 1: What is the number of graduates in the year 2010?

part 2: 
  (A) 6953
  (B) 5500
  (C) 8000
  (D) 8400

part 3: (A) 6953

To generate the incorrect options, I calculated 15% of the correct answer (6953), which is approximately 1043. I then rounded this number up to the nearest whole number, which remains 1043 (min_distance). The incorrect options were chosen to be at least 1043 away from the correct answer, ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect.
