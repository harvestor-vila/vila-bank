part 1: What is the difference in economic value between Texas and Oklahoma?

part 2: 
(A) 12563
(B) 10000
(C) 15000
(D) 17500

part 3: (A) 12563

To explain the process:

1. I calculated the precise correct answer using the provided dataset:
   Economic value of Texas = 30959
   Economic value of Oklahoma = 43522
   Difference = |43522 - 30959| = 12563

2. The precise correct answer (12563) is already at one decimal place, so the rounded correct answer is 12563.

3. I calculated what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and rounded this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of 12563 = 1884.45, which rounds up to 1885 = min_distance.

4. I generated three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   (B) 10000 (which is 2563 less than the correct answer, more than min_distance)
   (C) 15000 (which is 2437 more than the correct answer, more than min_distance)
   (D) 17500 (which is 4937 more than the correct answer, more than min_distance)

These steps ensure that the correct answer is one of the options in part 2 and that the incorrect options are unambiguously incorrect and at least min_distance away from the correct answer.
