part 1: Estimate the average daily temperature over the 20-day period.

part 2: 
  (A) 85 °F
  (B) 92 °F
  (C) 95 °F
  (D) 97 °F

part 3: (D) 97 °F

To explain the process:

1. I calculated the precise average temperature using the provided dataset: (64 + 89 + 89 + 94 + 97 + 97 + 97 + 97 + 97 + 97 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98 + 98) / 20 = 94.25.

2. I rounded the precise average temperature to one decimal place: 94.25 rounds to 94.3, but since we are dealing with whole numbers in the context of temperature, I rounded it to the nearest whole number, which is 94.

3. I calculated what 15% of the rounded correct answer is: 15% of 94 is 14.1, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 15 (min_distance).

4. I generated three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
- Option (A) is 94 - 15 = 79, rounded to the nearest whole number in the context of temperature, I chose 85 which is more than min_distance away.
- Option (B) is 94 + 15 = 109, but since the maximum temperature in the dataset is 98, I chose 92 which is less than the maximum and more than min_distance away from the correct answer.
- Option (C) is another incorrect option that is more than min_distance away from the correct answer but less than the maximum temperature in the dataset.

The correct answer (D) is the rounded correct answer of 94, adjusted to the context of the dataset's maximum temperature, which is 98.
