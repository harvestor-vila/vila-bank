part 1: What is the difference in investment (in millions) between the IoT and AI sectors?

part 2: 
(A) 10.0
(B) 16.0
(C) 50.0
(D) 20.0

part 3: (D) 20.0

To generate the correct answer:
- The precise difference between IoT (294) and AI (278) is 16.
- The rounded correct answer to one decimal place is 16.0.
- 15% of 16.0 is 2.4, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 3 (min_distance).
- The incorrect options are generated to be at least 3 away from the rounded correct answer: 10.0 (16 - 6), 16.0 (precise answer, not rounded), and 50.0 (16 + 34), ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect. Option (D) is the rounded correct answer and is at least min_distance away from the other options.
