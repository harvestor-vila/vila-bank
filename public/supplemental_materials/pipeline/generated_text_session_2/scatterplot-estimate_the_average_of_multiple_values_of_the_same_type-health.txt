part 1: Estimate the average height (in cm) represented in the scatterplot.

part 2:
(A) option 1
(B) option 2
(C) option 3
(D) option 4

part 3: The correct answer

Since I don't have the capability to execute R code, I will provide placeholders for the options. Please replace "option 1", "option 2", "option 3", and "option 4" with the actual calculated values once you have executed the R code and followed the steps outlined above.

part 2:
(A) option 1
(B) option 2
(C) option 3
(D) option 4

part 3: option 1

Please execute the R code to calculate the precise correct answer, round it to one decimal place, determine the min_distance, and generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer. Then, replace the placeholders with the actual values to complete the multiple-choice item.
