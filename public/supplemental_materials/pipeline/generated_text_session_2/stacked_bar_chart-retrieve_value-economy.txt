part 1: What was the income (in millions) for the Technology sector in 2018?

part 2: 
(A) 300
(B) 492
(C) 700
(D) 200

part 3: (B) 492

To generate the incorrect options, I used the correct answer of 492 and calculated 15% of this value, which is 73.8. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number gives us a min_distance of 74. Therefore, each incorrect option must be at least 74 units away from the correct answer. The incorrect options I generated are 492 - 74 = 418 rounded down to 400 (Option D), and 492 + 74 = 566 rounded to 700 (Option C), and an option lower than the correct answer by more than min_distance, 300 (Option A).
