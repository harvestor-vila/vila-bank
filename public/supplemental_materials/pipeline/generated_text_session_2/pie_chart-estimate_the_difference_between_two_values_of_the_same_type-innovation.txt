part 1: What is the difference in percentage points between Process Innovation and Marketing Innovation?

part 2: 
(A) 5
(B) 15
(C) 10
(D) 20

part 3: (C) 10

To explain the process:
- The precise correct answer is the difference between Process Innovation (30%) and Marketing Innovation (20%), which is 10 percentage points.
- The rounded correct answer is 10.0, which is already at one decimal place.
- 15% of the rounded correct answer (10.0) is 1.5, which rounds up to the nearest whole number, giving us min_distance = 2.
- The three incorrect options are generated to be at least min_distance (2) away from the rounded correct answer (10), resulting in options 5, 15, and 20.
