part 1: What is the ratio of the GDP Contribution of the Agriculture sector to that of the Manufacturing sector?

part 2: 
(A) 1.5
(B) 2.5
(C) 3.5
(D) 4.5

part 3: (B) 2.5

To explain the process:

1. Calculate the precise correct answer:
   Agriculture GDP Contribution = 278
   Manufacturing GDP Contribution = 113
   Ratio = Agriculture / Manufacturing = 278 / 113 â‰ˆ 2.4602

2. Round the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
   Rounded correct answer = 2.5

3. Calculate what 15% multiplies the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of 2.5 = 0.375
   Rounded up = 1 (min_distance)

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   Incorrect option 1: 2.5 - 1 = 1.5 (A)
   Incorrect option 2: 2.5 + 1 = 3.5 (C)
   Incorrect option 3: 2.5 + 2*1 = 4.5 (D)
