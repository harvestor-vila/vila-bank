part 1: What is the estimated difference in median age between the populations of 2000 and 4000?

To calculate the precise correct answer, we need to find the median ages for the closest population values to 2000 and 4000 in the dataset. From the dataset provided:

- The closest population value to 2000 is 2010 with a median age of 51.
- The closest population value to 4000 is 4003 with a median age of 79.

The precise correct answer is the difference between the median ages of these two populations: 79 - 51 = 28.

Now, we round the precise correct answer to one decimal place: 28.0 (since there is no digit after the decimal, it remains 28.0).

Next, we calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is: 15% of 28.0 is 4.2. We round this number up to the nearest whole number to get min_distance: 5.

Using min_distance, we generate three incorrect options that are at least 5 away from the rounded correct answer of 28.0:

- Option 1: 28.0 (correct answer)
- Option 2: 28.0 + 5 = 33.0
- Option 3: 28.0 - 5 = 23.0
- Option 4: 28.0 + 10 = 38.0 (since 5 + 5 = 10, which is still at least 5 away from 28.0)
- Option 5: 28.0 - 10 = 18.0 (since 5 + 5 = 10, which is still at least 5 away from 28.0)

We will use options 1, 2, 4, and 5 for our multiple-choice item.

part 2: 
  (A) 18.0
  (B) 23.0
  (C) 28.0
  (D) 38.0

part 3: (C) 28.0
