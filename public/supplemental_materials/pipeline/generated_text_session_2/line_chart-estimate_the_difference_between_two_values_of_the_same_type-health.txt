part 1: What is the difference in heart rate (bpm) between Day 5 and Day 10?

part 2: 
(A) 22 bpm
(B) 40 bpm
(C) 10 bpm
(D) 32 bpm

part 3: (A) 22 bpm

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset: the heart rate on Day 5 is 96 bpm and on Day 10 is 64 bpm. The difference is 96 - 64 = 32 bpm.
2. The precise correct answer (32) is rounded to one decimal place, which remains 32 as it is already a whole number.
3. Calculate 15% of the rounded correct answer: 15% of 32 is 4.8, which rounds up to the nearest whole number, giving us 5 (min_distance).
4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance (5 bpm) away from the rounded correct answer (32 bpm):
   - Option (A) is the correct answer, 32 bpm.
   - Option (B) is 32 + 5 * 2 = 42 bpm (rounded to 40 bpm for simplicity and to maintain a reasonable range).
   - Option (C) is 32 - 5 * 2 = 22 bpm (rounded to 20 bpm for simplicity and to maintain a reasonable range).
   - Option (D) is 32 + 5 * 3 = 47 bpm (rounded to 50 bpm for simplicity and to maintain a reasonable range).
   
However, to ensure that the incorrect options are unambiguously incorrect and at least min_distance away from the correct answer, we adjust them to:
   - Option (B) becomes 40 bpm (which is more than 5 bpm away from 32 bpm).
   - Option (C) becomes 10 bpm (which is more than 5 bpm away from 32 bpm).
   - Option (D) becomes 32 bpm + 10 = 42 bpm (which is more than 5 bpm away from 32 bpm). However, to avoid confusion with the correct answer, we adjust it to 32 bpm + 15 = 47 bpm, and then round it to maintain a reasonable range, resulting in 50 bpm. Since 50 bpm is not in the options, we choose a different incorrect value that is more than 5 bpm away, such as 22 bpm.

Please note that the incorrect options have been adjusted to ensure they are unambiguously incorrect and maintain a reasonable range for estimation tasks.
