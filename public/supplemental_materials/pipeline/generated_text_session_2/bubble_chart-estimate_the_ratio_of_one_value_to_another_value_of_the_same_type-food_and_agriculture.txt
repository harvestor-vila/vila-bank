part 1: What is the ratio of Soybean's Profit to its Production?

part 2: 
  (A) 0.8
  (B) 1.2
  (C) 1.5
  (D) 2.0

part 3: (B) 1.2

To explain the process:

1. Calculate the precise correct answer:
   Soybean's Profit: 109 (thousands of dollars)
   Soybean's Production: 91 (thousands of tonnes)
   Ratio = Profit / Production = 109 / 91 â‰ˆ 1.1978

2. Round the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
   Rounded correct answer = 1.2

3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of 1.2 = 0.18, rounded up to the nearest whole number = 1 (min_distance)

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   Option (A) 0.8 (1.2 - 1 * 2 = 0.2, rounded to the nearest tenth is 0.8)
   Option (C) 1.5 (1.2 + 1 * 3 = 1.5)
   Option (D) 2.0 (1.2 + 1 * 8 = 2.0)
