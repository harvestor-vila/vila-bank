part 1: What is the ratio of Socialist Party's funding to its number of seats?

part 2: 
(A) 303.0
(B) 200.0
(C) 100.0
(D) 400.0

part 3: (A) 303.0

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the Socialist Party's funding (3,951,286) divided by its number of seats (13), which equals approximately 303.9458.
2. The precise correct answer is then rounded to one decimal place, resulting in 303.9, which is the rounded correct answer.
3. 15% of the rounded correct answer (303.9) is 45.585, which is then rounded up to the nearest whole number, resulting in a min_distance of 46.
4. Three incorrect options are generated that are at least min_distance (46) away from the rounded correct answer (303.9). These options are 200.0, 100.0, and 400.0. Each of these options is more than 46 units away from the correct answer of 303.9, ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect.
