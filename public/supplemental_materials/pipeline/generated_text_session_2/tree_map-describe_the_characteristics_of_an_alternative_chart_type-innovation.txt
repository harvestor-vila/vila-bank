(C) A stacked bar chart would represent each category as a horizontal bar, with subcategories represented as segments within the bar, proportionally sized according to their percentage values.
(D) A stacked bar chart would display each subcategory as a pie slice, with the size of the slice corresponding to the percentage value, and different colors for each category.
