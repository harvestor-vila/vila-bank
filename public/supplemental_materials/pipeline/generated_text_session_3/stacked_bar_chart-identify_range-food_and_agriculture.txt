part 1: What is the range of agricultural production values across all products and regions?

part 2: options
(A) [96, 1116]
(B) [113, 970]
(C) [80, 1200]
(D) [90, 1150]

part 3: the correct answer
(B) [113, 970]

The new incorrect options (A), (C), and (D) now satisfy the conditions:
(A) Lower bound is 113 - 96 = 17 units smaller than 113, and upper bound is 1116 - 970 = 146 units larger than 970.
(C) Lower bound is 113 - 80 = 33 units smaller than 113, and upper bound is 1200 - 970 = 230 units larger than 970.
(D) Lower bound is 113 - 90 = 23 units smaller than 113, and upper bound is 1150 - 970 = 180 units larger than 970.
