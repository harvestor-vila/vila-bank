part 1: If the scatterplot showing the relationship between Weight and Height were to be replaced with a box plot, which of the following would best describe its characteristics?
    part 2: 
    (A) The box plot would show the distribution of Weight and Height on a single axis, with individual data points represented as dots.
    (B) The box plot would display the mean Weight and Height values with error bars indicating the range of the data.
    (C) The box plot would illustrate the central tendency and variability of Weight and Height separately, using boxes to represent the interquartile range and whiskers for the total range.
    (D) The box plot would provide a pie chart representation of the proportion of Weight to Height for each individual data point.
    part 3: (C) The box plot would illustrate the central tendency and variability of Weight and Height separately, using boxes to represent the interquartile range and whiskers for the total range.
