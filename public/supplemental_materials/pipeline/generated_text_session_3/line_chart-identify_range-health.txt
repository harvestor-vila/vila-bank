part 1: What is the range of heart rate values depicted in the daily measurements?

part 2:
  (A) [45, 111]
  (B) [62, 96]
  (C) [52, 111]
  (D) [51, 112]

part 3: (B) [62, 96]

For the new incorrect options, I have ensured that the lower bound is at least 10 smaller than the minimum value (62 - 10 = 52) and the upper bound is at least 15 larger than the maximum value (96 + 15 = 111). Option (D) is also adjusted to maintain the incorrectness criteria (62 - 10 = 52 rounded down to 51, and 96 + 15 = 111 rounded up to 112).
