part 1: If the population distribution by age group were to be displayed using a pie chart instead of a bar chart, which of the following would be an accurate description of the pie chart's characteristics?
    part 2: 
    (A) Each age group would be represented by a slice, with the slice size proportional to the age group's share of the total population.
    (B) The pie chart would show a series of concentric circles, each representing an age group with its radius corresponding to the population size.
    (C) Age groups would be displayed as individual points plotted along a common scale, with the distance from the center indicating population size.
    (D) The pie chart would consist of stacked horizontal bars, with each bar's length representing the population size of an age group.
    part 3: (A) Each age group would be represented by a slice, with the slice size proportional to the age group's share of the total population.
