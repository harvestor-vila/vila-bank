part 1: What is the range of average test scores represented in the bubble chart?

part 2:
  (A) [47, 113]
  (B) [52, 113]
  (C) [47, 108]
  (D) [62, 98]

part 3: (D) [62, 98]

The new incorrect options (A), (B), and (C) now correctly extend beyond the range by at least distance_min and distance_max, making them unambiguously incorrect. The correct answer remains the same as the one identified from the dataset.
