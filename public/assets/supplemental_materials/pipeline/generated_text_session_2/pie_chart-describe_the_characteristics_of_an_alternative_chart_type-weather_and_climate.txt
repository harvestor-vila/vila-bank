part 2: 
(A) Each climate category would be represented by a separate bar, with the length of each bar proportional to the percentage of the total.
(B) Climate categories would be represented by concentric circles with varying radii corresponding to their percentages.
(C) Climate categories would be represented by points plotted on a map, with the size of each point proportional to the percentage.
(D) Climate categories would be represented by segments of a single bar stacked end-to-end, with the length of each segment proportional to its percentage.

part 3: (D) Climate categories would be represented by segments of a single bar stacked end-to-end, with the length of each segment proportional to its percentage.
