part 1: What is the ratio of Party A's percentage on Healthcare to Party D's percentage on the same issue?

part 2: 
  (A) 2.5
  (B) 8.5
  (C) 6.0
  (D) 10.0

part 3: (B) 8.5

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset:
   Party A's percentage on Healthcare is 34.
   Party D's percentage on Healthcare is 4.
   The ratio is 34 / 4 = 8.5.

2. The precise correct answer (8.5) is already rounded to one decimal place.

3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of 8.5 is 1.275, which rounds up to 2 (min_distance).

4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance (2) away from the rounded correct answer (8.5):
   (A) 8.5 - 2 * 2 = 4.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number gives 5, but we need to ensure it's at least 2 away, so we choose 6.0)
   (C) 8.5 + 2 = 10.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number gives 11, but we choose 10.0 to ensure it's at least 2 away)
   (D) 8.5 + 2 * 2 = 12.5 (rounded to the nearest whole number gives 13, but we choose an option that is at least 2 away, so we go down to 8.5 - 3 * 2 = 2.5)
