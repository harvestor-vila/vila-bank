part 1: What is the ratio of the number of yields per acre that are exactly 0 to the number of yields per acre that are exactly 1?

part 2: 
  (A) 0.1
  (B) 1.1

Please note that the incorrect options are deliberately chosen to be at least the minimum distance away from the correct answer, ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect. The test taker should be able to estimate the correct answer using the histogram visualization, which would show the frequency of yields per acre at 0 and 1, allowing them to visually estimate the ratio.
