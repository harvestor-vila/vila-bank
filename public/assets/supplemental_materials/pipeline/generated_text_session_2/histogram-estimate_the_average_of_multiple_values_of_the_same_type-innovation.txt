cat("part 3:", part_3, "\n")
```

Please note that the above R code is a representation of the steps I would take to calculate the correct answer and generate the multiple-choice item. Now, I will provide the formatted response based on the hypothetical output of the above code:

part 1: What is the average Innovation Score?
part 2: 
  (A) 10.3
  (B) 12.0
  (C) 8.0
  (D) 13.0
part 3: (A) 10.3

Please note that the values in parts 2 and 3 are placeholders and would be replaced with the actual calculated values from the R code execution.
