Please note that the above R code is a representation of the steps I would take to calculate the correct answer and generate the multiple-choice item. Since I cannot execute code, I will simulate the expected output based on typical R code execution.

part 1: What is the average number of votes received by the candidates in the hypothetical primary election?
part 2: 
  (A) 30.0
  (B) 35.0
  (C) 25.0
  (D) 40.0
part 3: 30.0

Please note that the options provided in part 2 are placeholders and the actual values would depend on the calculations performed using the R code.
