part 1: If the scatterplot showing Population vs Median Age were to be represented as a line chart, which of the following would best describe its characteristics?

part 2: 
(A) The line chart would show a series of peaks and valleys with no discernible trend, as the data points are randomly distributed.
(B) The line chart would show a horizontal line, indicating no change in median age across different population sizes.
(C) The line chart would show a downward trend, indicating a negative correlation between population size and median age.
(D) The line chart would show an upward trend, indicating that as the population size increases, the median age also increases.

part 3: (C) The line chart would show a downward trend, indicating a negative correlation between population size and median age.
