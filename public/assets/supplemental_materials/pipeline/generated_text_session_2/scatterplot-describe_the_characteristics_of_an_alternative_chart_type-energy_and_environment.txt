part 1: If the scatterplot showing Energy Consumption vs. Carbon Emission were to be represented as a boxplot, which of the following descriptions would accurately characterize this alternative chart type?

part 2: 
(A) A boxplot would show the distribution of Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission separately, with boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values.
(B) A boxplot would display the average Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission as single points, with error bars representing standard deviation.
(C) A boxplot would connect median values of Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission, forming a line chart within a box.
(D) A boxplot would illustrate the cumulative frequency of Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission data points as a step function.

part 3: (A) A boxplot would show the distribution of Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission separately, with boxes indicating the interquartile range and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum values.
