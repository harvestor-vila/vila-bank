part 1: What is the ratio of votes for the Socialist party to the votes for the Libertarian party?

part 2: 
  (A) 3.5
  (B) 4.5
  (C) 5.5
  (D) 6.5

part 3: (B) 4.5

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated by dividing the votes for the Socialist party by the votes for the Libertarian party: 8817 / 1941 ≈ 4.542.
2. The precise correct answer is rounded to one decimal place: 4.542 rounds to 4.5.
3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and round this number up to the nearest whole number: 0.15 * 4.5 ≈ 0.675, which rounds up to 1.
4. The min_distance is 1. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer: 3.5, 5.5, and 6.5.
