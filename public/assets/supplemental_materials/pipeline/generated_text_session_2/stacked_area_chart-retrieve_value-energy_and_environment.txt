part 1: What was the energy production (GWh) from Wind sources in the year 2019?

part 2: 
(A) 200 GWh
(B) 312 GWh
(C) 450 GWh
(D) 600 GWh

part 3: (B) 312 GWh

To generate the incorrect options, I used the correct answer (312 GWh) and calculated 15% of this value, which is 46.8 GWh. Rounding this up to the nearest whole number gives a min_distance of 47 GWh. The incorrect options were then chosen to be at least 47 GWh away from the correct answer, ensuring that they are unambiguously incorrect.
