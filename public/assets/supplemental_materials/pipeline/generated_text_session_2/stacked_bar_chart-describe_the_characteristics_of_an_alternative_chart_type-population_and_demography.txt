part 1: If the population distribution by region and age group were to be displayed using a pie chart instead of a stacked bar chart, which of the following would be a characteristic of the pie chart?

part 2: 
(A) Each region would be represented by a separate pie chart, with slices proportional to the age group populations within that region.
(B) The pie chart would have slices representing each region, with the size of each slice proportional to the total population across all age groups.
(C) The pie chart would show a single slice for each age group, with the size of the slice representing the average population of that group across all regions.
(D) The pie chart would have slices representing each age group, with the size of each slice proportional to the population of that group within a single region.

part 3: (A) Each region would be represented by a separate pie chart, with slices proportional to the age group populations within that region.
