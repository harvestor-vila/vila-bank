part 1: What is the estimated difference in votes between the years 2003 and 2008?

part 2: 
  (A) 200 votes
  (B) 292 votes
  (C) 350 votes
  (D) 100 votes

part 3: (B) 292 votes

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset: the votes in 2003 (405 votes) minus the votes in 2008 (113 votes), which equals 292 votes.
2. The precise correct answer (292) is already rounded to one decimal place, so the rounded correct answer is 292 votes.
3. Calculating 15% of the rounded correct answer: 0.15 * 292 = 43.8, which is rounded up to the nearest whole number, giving us 44 votes as the min_distance.
4. Generating three incorrect options that are at least 44 votes away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 200 votes (92 votes away from the correct answer)
   - Option (C) 350 votes (58 votes away from the correct answer)
   - Option (D) 100 votes (192 votes away from the correct answer)
