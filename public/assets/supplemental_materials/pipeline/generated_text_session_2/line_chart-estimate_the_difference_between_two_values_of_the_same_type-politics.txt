part 1: What is the difference in the Approval Rating between the years 2000 and 2019?

part 2: 
(A) 30
(B) 36
(C) 42
(D) 48

part 3: (A) 36

To generate the correct answer and the incorrect options, I followed these steps:

1. Calculated the precise correct answer using the dataset:
   The Approval Rating in 2000 is 68 and in 2019 is 32. The difference is 68 - 32 = 36.

2. Rounded the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
   The difference is already a whole number, so the rounded correct answer is 36.

3. Calculated what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and rounded this number up to the nearest whole number to get min_distance:
   15% of 36 is 5.4, which rounds up to 6. Therefore, min_distance is 6.

4. Generated three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   (B) 36 + 6 = 42
   (C) 36 + 2*6 = 48
   (D) 36 - 6 = 30

These steps ensure that the correct answer (A) 36 is included in part 2 and that the three incorrect options are at least min_distance away from the correct answer.
