part 1: What is the average production value (in tonnes) for the food items shown in the bar chart?

part 2: options
(A) 350
(B) 480
(C) 545
(D) 418

part 3: the correct answer
(D) 418

The new options are calculated as follows:
- The correct answer (D) remains 418, which is the rounded value of the precise average 417.6.
- Option (A) is now 350, which is 68 away from 418 and more than min_distance of 63.
- Option (B) is 480, which is 62 away from 418 and less than min_distance, so it should be adjusted. I will change it to 481, which is 63 away and meets the min_distance requirement.
- Option (C) is 545, which is 127 away from 418 and more than min_distance.

The finalized item is:
