    (B) The chart would consist of concentric circles, each representing a different sector, with the circle sizes proportional to their percentages.
    (C) Sectors would be represented by points plotted on a grid, with the position of each point corresponding to its percentage value.
    (D) Sectors would be represented by segments of a single horizontal bar, stacked side by side, with segment lengths proportional to the sector's percentage.
    part 3: (D) Sectors would be represented by segments of a single horizontal bar, stacked side by side, with segment lengths proportional to the sector's percentage.
