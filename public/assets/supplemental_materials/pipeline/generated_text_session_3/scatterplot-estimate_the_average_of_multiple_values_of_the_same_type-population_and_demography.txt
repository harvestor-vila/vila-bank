part 1: What is the average median age depicted in the scatterplot?
part 2: 
  (A) 57.6
  (B) 41.6
  (C) 65.6
  (D) 49.6
part 3: (D) 49.6
```

If the calculated average median age is not 49.6, or the incorrect options are not at the correct distance from the correct answer, I would provide the corrected item with an explanation of the mistake.
