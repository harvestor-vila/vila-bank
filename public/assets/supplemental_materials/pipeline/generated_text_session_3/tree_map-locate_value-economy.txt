part 1: Which subcategory represents the smallest percentage of the economy?
part 2: 
(A) Crops
(B) Livestock
(C) Textiles
(D) Hardware
part 3: (B) Livestock

The provided correct answer is (B) Livestock, which matches the correct answer I found using the dataset. Additionally, the incorrect options (A) Crops, (C) Textiles, and (D) Hardware are all unambiguously incorrect because their percentages are higher than that of Livestock.

Therefore, there are no mistakes in this item. The finalized item is:
