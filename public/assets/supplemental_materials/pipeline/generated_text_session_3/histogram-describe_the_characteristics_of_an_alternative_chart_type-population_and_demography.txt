part 1: If the age distribution of the population were to be displayed using a histogram, which of the following would be an accurate description of its appearance?

part 2: 
(A) The histogram would show a symmetric distribution with most of the ages concentrated in the middle bins.
(B) The histogram would display a right-skewed distribution with most of the ages concentrated in the bins on the left side.
(C) The histogram would have a uniform distribution with equal counts in all age bins.
(D) The histogram would show a left-skewed distribution with most of the ages concentrated in the bins on the right side.

part 3: (B) The histogram would display a right-skewed distribution with most of the ages concentrated in the bins on the left side.

This new item is based on the typical shape of a histogram generated from a binomial distribution with `prob = 0.3` and the fact that the dataset is sorted in decreasing order, which suggests that there will be more counts in the lower age bins (left side) and fewer counts in the higher age bins (right side), indicating a right-skewed distribution. Options (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect descriptions of the histogram based on the given dataset.
