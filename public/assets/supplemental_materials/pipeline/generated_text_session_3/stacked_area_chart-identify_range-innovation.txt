part 1: What is the range of the number of innovations across all categories from 2000 to 2019?

part 2: 
(A) [42, 230]
(B) [50, 200]
(C) [35, 245]
(D) [30, 240]

part 3: (B) [50, 200]

The new incorrect options (A), (C), and (D) have been created such that the lower bound is at least distance_min smaller than min_value (50 - 8 = 42) and the upper bound is at least distance_max larger than max_value (200 + 30 = 230). These options are now clearly and unambiguously incorrect.
