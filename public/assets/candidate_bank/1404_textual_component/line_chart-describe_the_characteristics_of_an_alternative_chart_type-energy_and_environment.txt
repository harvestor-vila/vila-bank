part 1: If the Energy Consumption Over Time data were to be displayed using a bar chart, which of the following characteristics would it most likely have?
    part 2: 
    (A) Each time point would be represented by a pie slice, with the size of the slice proportional to the energy consumption at that time.
    (B) Time points would be represented along the horizontal axis, and individual bars would extend vertically to indicate energy consumption values.
    (C) Energy consumption values would be plotted along a continuous curve, with peaks representing higher values.
    (D) Bars would be stacked on top of each other for each time point, with the total height representing cumulative energy consumption.
    part 3: (B) Time points would be represented along the horizontal axis, and individual bars would extend vertically to indicate energy consumption values.
