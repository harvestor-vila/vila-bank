part 1: If the GDP Contribution by Sector data were to be displayed using a pie chart instead of a bar chart, which of the following would be a correct characteristic of the pie chart?
    part 2: 
    (A) Each sector's contribution to GDP would be represented by a slice, with the angle of each slice corresponding to the sector's relative percentage of the total GDP.
    (B) Sectors with higher GDP contributions would be represented by slices closer to the center of the pie, while those with lower contributions would be on the outer edge.
    (C) The pie chart would display each sector's GDP contribution as equal-sized slices, with color intensity indicating the contribution amount.
    (D) The pie chart would arrange sectors alphabetically in a clockwise direction, with the size of each slice representing the absolute GDP contribution value.
    part 3: (A) Each sector's contribution to GDP would be represented by a slice, with the angle of each slice corresponding to the sector's relative percentage of the total GDP.
