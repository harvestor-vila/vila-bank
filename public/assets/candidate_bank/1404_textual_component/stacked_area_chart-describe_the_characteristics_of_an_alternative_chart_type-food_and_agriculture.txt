part 1: If the production data for crops over the years were to be displayed using a line chart instead of a stacked area chart, which of the following would be a characteristic of the line chart?
    part 2: 
    (A) The line chart would show the cumulative production of all crops combined, with each crop's contribution indistinguishable from the others.
    (B) The line chart would overlay lines for each crop type, allowing for comparison of individual crop production trends over time.
    (C) The line chart would stack lines on top of each other, representing the total production for each year.
    (D) The line chart would display bars for each crop type side by side for each year, making it difficult to track changes over time.
    part 3: (B) The line chart would overlay lines for each crop type, allowing for comparison of individual crop production trends over time.
