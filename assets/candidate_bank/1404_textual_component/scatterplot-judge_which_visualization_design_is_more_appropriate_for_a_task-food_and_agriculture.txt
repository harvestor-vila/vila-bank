part 1:  The visualization above is only a demonstration of the relevant data. Which visualization design would be most appropriate for assessing the strength and direction of the relationship between Crop Yield and Fertilizer Use?

part 2:
(A) A pie chart comparing the proportion of different crop yield ranges to total yield.
(B) A scatterplot with a trend line to visualize the correlation between Crop Yield and Fertilizer Use.
(C) A bar graph showing the average Fertilizer Use for different ranges of Crop Yield.
(D) A stacked area chart showing the cumulative Fertilizer Use over different Crop Yield values.

part 3:   (B) A scatterplot with a trend line to visualize the correlation between Crop Yield and Fertilizer Use.
