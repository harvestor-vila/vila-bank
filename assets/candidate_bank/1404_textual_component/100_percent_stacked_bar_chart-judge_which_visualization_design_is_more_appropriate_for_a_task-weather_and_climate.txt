part 1:  Given the need to compare the proportional distribution of weather types across different locations, which visualization design would be most appropriate? The visualization above is only a demonstration of the relevant data.

part 2:
(A) A pie chart for each location showing the proportion of each weather type.
(B) A line graph showing the change in weather types over time for each location.
(C) A scatter plot with weather types on the x-axis and percentage on the y-axis, colored by location.
(D) A 100 percent stacked bar chart with locations on the x-axis, percentage on the y-axis, and segments colored by weather type.

part 3:   (D) A 100 percent stacked bar chart with locations on the x-axis, percentage on the y-axis, and segments colored by weather type.
