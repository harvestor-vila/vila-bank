part 1: Which patient is represented by the largest bubble on the bubble chart?
    part 2: 
    (A) Patient 1
    (B) Patient 2
    (C) Patient 3
    (D) Patient 4
    part 3: (B) Patient 2

This new item asks for the patient with the largest bubble, which is determined by the CholesterolLevel. Based on the dataset, Patient 2 has the highest CholesterolLevel (286) and therefore the largest bubble. The other options are incorrect as their CholesterolLevels are lower.
