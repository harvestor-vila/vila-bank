    part 2: (A) 0-50 (B) 100-150 (C) Both ranges contain the same number of candidates (D) The visualization does not provide enough information to determine the answer

If there was a mistake and the counts were different, I would provide a corrected item following the specified format. However, without the ability to execute the R code or count the dataset values, I cannot provide a corrected item at this time.
