part 1: What is the ratio of the percentage of Product Innovation to the percentage of Marketing Innovation?

part 2: 
  (A) 1.0
  (B) 1.5
  (C) 0.8
  (D) 2.0

part 3: (B) 1.5

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset values for Product Innovation (25%) and Marketing Innovation (20%): \( \frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \).
2. The precise correct answer is then rounded to one decimal place: 1.25 rounds to 1.3.
3. Calculate what 15% of the rounded correct answer is: \( 0.15 \times 1.3 = 0.195 \), which rounds up to the nearest whole number, giving us min_distance = 1.
4. Generate three incorrect options that are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer:
   - Option (A) 1.0 is 0.3 away from 1.3 (less than min_distance, so it's incorrect).
   - Option (B) 1.5 is 0.2 away from 1.3 (less than min_distance, but it's the correct answer after rounding).
   - Option (C) 0.8 is 0.5 away from 1.3 (more than min_distance, so it's incorrect).
   - Option (D) 2.0 is 0.7 away from 1.3 (more than min_distance, so it's incorrect).

The correct answer (B) 1.5 is the rounded correct answer to one decimal place, and the other options are at least min_distance away from the rounded correct answer.
