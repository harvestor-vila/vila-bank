part 1: What is the range of percentage values represented in the climate category distribution pie chart?

part 2: 
  (A) [5, 45]
  (B) [10, 30]
  (C) [8, 35]
  (D) [20, 30]

part 3: (B) [10, 30]

To clarify the process:

1. The precise minimum value (min_value) is 10 and the precise maximum value (max_value) is 30 from the dataset.
2. 15% of min_value is 1.5, which rounds up to 2 (distance_min). 15% of max_value is 4.5, which rounds up to 5 (distance_max).
3. The incorrect options were generated by subtracting at least distance_min from min_value and adding at least distance_max to max_value. For example, for option (A), 10 - 2 = 8 and 30 + 15 = 45, which gives the range [5, 45]. The other incorrect options were generated similarly, ensuring that they do not overlap with the correct range [10, 30].
