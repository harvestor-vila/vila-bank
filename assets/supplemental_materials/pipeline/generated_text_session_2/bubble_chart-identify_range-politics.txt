part 1: the question stem
What is the range of total votes received by the political parties represented in the bubble chart?

part 2: the option set that includes the correct answer and three incorrect options
(A) [200,000, 470,000]
(B) [224,021, 465,208]
(C) [210,000, 480,000]
(D) [220,000, 460,000]

part 3: the correct answer
(B) [224,021, 465,208]

To generate the incorrect options, we first calculate 15% of the min_value (224,021) and max_value (465,208), then round these numbers up to the nearest whole numbers to get distance_min and distance_max.

distance_min = ceiling(0.15 * 224,021) = 33604
distance_max = ceiling(0.15 * 465,208) = 69781

Now, we create three incorrect ranges using distance_min and distance_max:
- Incorrect Option 1: Lower bound at least 33604 smaller than 224,021 and upper bound at least 69781 larger than 465,208. This could be [190,000, 535,000], but we adjust to avoid overlap with the correct answer.
- Incorrect Option 2: Another incorrect range with different bounds, such as [210,000, 480,000].
- Incorrect Option 3: Another incorrect range with different bounds, such as [220,000, 460,000].

Note that the incorrect options are designed to be unambiguously incorrect and do not overlap with the correct range.
