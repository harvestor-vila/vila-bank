part 1: What is the ratio of the percentage value for "Hypertension" to the percentage value for "Stroke"?

part 2: 
(A) 1.0
(B) 2.0
(C) 3.0
(D) 4.0

part 3: (C) 3.0

Explanation for the answer:
Using the dataset provided, we can see that "Hypertension" has a percentage value of 15 and "Stroke" has a percentage value of 5. The precise correct answer for the ratio of "Hypertension" to "Stroke" is 15 / 5 = 3. This is already rounded to one decimal place, so the rounded correct answer is 3.0.

To calculate min_distance, we take 15% of the rounded correct answer, which is 0.15 * 3.0 = 0.45. Rounding this number up to the nearest whole number gives us 1.

Now, we need to generate three incorrect options that are at least 1 unit away from the rounded correct answer of 3.0:

- Option (A) 1.0 is 2 units away from the correct answer.
- Option (B) 2.0 is 1 unit away from the correct answer.
- Option (D) 4.0 is 1 unit away from the correct answer.

These incorrect options are all at least min_distance away from the correct answer, fulfilling the requirement.
