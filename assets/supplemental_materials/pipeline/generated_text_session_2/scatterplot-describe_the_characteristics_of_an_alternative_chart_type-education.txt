part 1: If the scatterplot showing Study Hours vs Average Grade of Students were to be represented as a box plot, which of the following descriptions would accurately characterize it?

part 2: 
(A) The box plot would display the distribution of Average Grades, with boxes representing the interquartile range for each hour of study, and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum grades.
(B) The box plot would show a single box representing the combined study hours of all students, with the median study time highlighted.
(C) The box plot would illustrate the average number of study hours per grade, with outliers for each grade shown as individual points.
(D) The box plot would have a separate box for each student, showing the variability in their study hours and grades over time.

part 3: (A) The box plot would display the distribution of Average Grades, with boxes representing the interquartile range for each hour of study, and whiskers extending to the minimum and maximum grades.
