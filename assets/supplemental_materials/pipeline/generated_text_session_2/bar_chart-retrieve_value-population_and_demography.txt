part 1: What is the population size for the age group "25-44"?

part 2: 
  (A) 2743
  (B) 3226
  (C) 3709
  (D) 4500

part 3: (B) 3226

Explanation for the creation of options:
- The correct answer is taken directly from the dataset, which is 3226 for the age group "25-44".
- To calculate min_distance, we take 15% of the correct answer: 0.15 * 3226 = 483.9, which we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us 484.
- The incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting multiples of min_distance from the correct answer, ensuring that each incorrect option is at least min_distance away from the correct answer:
  - Option (A): 3226 - 484 = 2742, rounded to 2743 to ensure it's at least min_distance away.
  - Option (C): 3226 + 484 = 3710, rounded down to 3709 to ensure it's at least min_distance away.
  - Option (D): 3226 + (2 * 484) = 4194, rounded up to 4500 to ensure it's a round number that's still more than min_distance away.
