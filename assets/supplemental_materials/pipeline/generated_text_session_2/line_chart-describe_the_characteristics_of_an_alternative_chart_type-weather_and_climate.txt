part 1: If the daily average temperature data over 20 days were to be displayed using a histogram, which of the following best describes its characteristics?

part 2: 
(A) The histogram would show the distribution of days across different temperature ranges, with each bar representing a unique day and its corresponding temperature.
(B) The histogram would display a pie chart with slices representing the proportion of days within certain temperature ranges.
(C) The histogram would consist of bars that represent the frequency of temperature ranges, with the height of each bar indicating how many days fell into each temperature range.
(D) The histogram would connect points representing daily temperatures with lines, showing the trend of temperature change over the 20-day period.

part 3: (C) The histogram would consist of bars that represent the frequency of temperature ranges, with the height of each bar indicating how many days fell into each temperature range.
