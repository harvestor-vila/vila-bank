part 1: What is the value of energy consumption for the state of Texas?

part 2: 
(A) 600
(B) 945
(C) 818
(D) 1100

part 3: (C) 818

To explain the process:
- The correct answer is taken directly from the dataset, which lists Texas with a value of 818.
- To calculate min_distance, 15% of 818 is 122.7, which rounds up to 123.
- The three incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting at least 123 from the correct answer, ensuring that each incorrect option is at least min_distance away from the correct answer. The options chosen are 600 (218 away), 945 (127 away), and 1100 (282 away).
