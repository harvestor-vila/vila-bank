part 1: What is the estimated difference in agricultural production (in tons) between the years 2011 and 2016?

part 2: 
  (A) 2 tons
  (B) 15 tons
  (C) 83 tons
  (D) 102 tons

part 3: (A) 2 tons

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset:
   Production in 2011: 189 tons
   Production in 2016: 191 tons
   Difference: 191 - 189 = 2 tons

2. The precise correct answer is 2 tons, which is already rounded to one decimal place.

3. Calculating 15% of the rounded correct answer:
   15% of 2 = 0.3, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 1 (min_distance).

4. Generating three incorrect options that are at least min_distance (1 ton) away from the rounded correct answer (2 tons):
   (A) 2 tons (correct answer)
   (B) 15 tons (incorrect, more than min_distance away)
   (C) 83 tons (incorrect, more than min_distance away)
   (D) 102 tons (incorrect, more than min_distance away)
