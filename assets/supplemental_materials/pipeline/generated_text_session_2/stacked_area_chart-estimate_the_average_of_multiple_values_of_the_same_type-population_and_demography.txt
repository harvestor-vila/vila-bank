part 1: What is the average population for the age group "0-14" from 2000 to 2019?

part 2: 
  (A) option 1
  (B) option 2
  (C) option 3
  (D) option 4

part 3: The correct answer

Since I do not have the capability to execute R code, I cannot provide the precise average or the subsequent calculations. However, I can illustrate how the options might look once you have the precise average:

Assuming the precise average `X` was 50000, and the rounded correct answer `Y` is 50000.0, then 15% of `Y` is 7500, which we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us `min_distance` of 7500.

The correct answer and the three incorrect options could be:

part 2: 
  (A) 42500
  (B) 50000
  (C) 57500
  (D) 65000

part 3: (B) 50000

Please replace the values in part 2 and part 3 with the actual calculated values based on the dataset provided.
