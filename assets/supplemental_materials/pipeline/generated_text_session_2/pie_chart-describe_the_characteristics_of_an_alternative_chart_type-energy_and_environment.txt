part 1: If the data on energy sources distribution were to be displayed using a stacked bar chart instead of a pie chart, which of the following would be an accurate description of its characteristics?

part 2: 
(A) Each energy source would be represented by a separate bar, with bar lengths proportional to the percentage of total energy production.
(B) Energy sources would be represented by concentric circles, with the radius of each circle corresponding to its percentage of total energy production.
(C) Energy sources would be represented by segments of a circle, with the angle of each segment corresponding to its percentage of total energy production.
(D) Energy sources would be stacked in a single bar, with the length of each segment within the bar corresponding to its percentage of total energy production.

part 3: (D) Energy sources would be stacked in a single bar, with the length of each segment within the bar corresponding to its percentage of total energy production.
