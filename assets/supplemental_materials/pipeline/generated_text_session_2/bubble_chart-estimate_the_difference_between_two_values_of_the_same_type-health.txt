part 1: Estimate the difference in Cholesterol Level (mg/dL) between Patient 2 and Patient 4.

part 2: 
  (A) 56 mg/dL
  (B) 24 mg/dL
  (C) 75 mg/dL
  (D) 100 mg/dL

part 3: (A) 56 mg/dL

To explain the process:

1. The precise correct answer is calculated using the dataset:
   Cholesterol Level of Patient 2 - Cholesterol Level of Patient 4 = 286 - 230 = 56

2. The precise correct answer is 56, which is already rounded to one decimal place.

3. 15% of the rounded correct answer is 0.15 * 56 = 8.4, which rounds up to the nearest whole number as 9 (min_distance).

4. The three incorrect options are generated by adding or subtracting the min_distance from the correct answer and ensuring they are at least min_distance away:
   (A) 56 mg/dL (correct answer)
   (B) 56 - 9 = 47 mg/dL (rounded to the nearest whole number, but this is less than min_distance away, so we adjust to 56 - 15 = 41 mg/dL, which is still too close, so we choose 24 mg/dL which is a safe distance away)
   (C) 56 + 9 = 65 mg/dL (rounded to the nearest whole number, but this is less than min_distance away, so we adjust to 56 + 15 = 71 mg/dL, which is still too close, so we choose 75 mg/dL which is a safe distance away)
   (D) 56 + 2*9 = 74 mg/dL (rounded to the nearest whole number, but this is less than min_distance away, so we adjust to 56 + 2*15 = 86 mg/dL, which is still too close, so we choose 100 mg/dL which is a safe distance away)

These incorrect options are then formatted and included in part 2.
