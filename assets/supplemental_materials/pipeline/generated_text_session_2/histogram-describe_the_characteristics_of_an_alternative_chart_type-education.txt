part 1: If the distribution of standardized test scores were to be displayed using a box plot, which of the following would be an accurate description of its appearance?

part 2: 
(A) The box plot would show a symmetrical distribution with equal-length whiskers and a median line located centrally within the box.
(B) The box plot would display a left-skewed distribution with the median line closer to the upper quartile and the lower whisker longer than the upper whisker.
(C) The box plot would show a right-skewed distribution with the median line closer to the lower quartile and the upper whisker longer than the lower whisker.
(D) The box plot would have no whiskers, indicating no variability in the test scores, with a median line at the score of 100.

part 3: (C) The box plot would show a right-skewed distribution with the median line closer to the lower quartile and the upper whisker longer than the lower whisker.
