part 1: Estimate the difference in school funding between School D and School E.

part 2: 
(A) $1 million
(B) $2 million
(C) $3 million
(D) $5 million

part 3: (A) $1 million

To create this multiple-choice item, I followed the procedure:

1. Calculated the precise correct answer using the dataset:
   School D Funding = $10,000,000
   School E Funding = $9,000,000
   Difference = School D Funding - School E Funding = $10,000,000 - $9,000,000 = $1,000,000

2. Rounded the precise correct answer to one decimal place:
   The difference is already a whole number, so the rounded correct answer is $1 million.

3. Calculated what 15% of the rounded correct answer is and rounded this number up to the nearest whole number:
   15% of $1 million = $150,000
   Rounded up to the nearest whole number = $150,000 (no change needed as it is already a whole number)

4. Generated three incorrect options that are at least $150,000 (min_distance) away from the rounded correct answer:
   (B) $2 million (rounded correct answer + min_distance + extra)
   (C) $3 million (rounded correct answer + 2 * min_distance + extra)
   (D) $5 million (rounded correct answer + 4 * min_distance + extra)
