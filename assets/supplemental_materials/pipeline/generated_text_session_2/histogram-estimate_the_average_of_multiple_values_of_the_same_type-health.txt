part 1: What is the average cholesterol level as depicted in the histogram?

part 2: 
  (A) option 1
  (B) option 2
  (C) option 3
  (D) option 4

part 3: the correct answer

Since I am simulating the R code execution, let's assume the precise average calculated was 162.3, and after rounding, the rounded correct answer is 162.3. If the `min_distance` is calculated to be 25 (15% of 162.3, rounded up), the incorrect options could be:

- Option 1: 162.3 (the correct answer)
- Option 2: 137 (25 less than the correct answer)
- Option 3: 187 (25 more than the correct answer)
- Option 4: 112 (50 less than the correct answer)

Now, I will format the response according to the instructions:

part 1: What is the average cholesterol level as depicted in the histogram?

part 2: 
  (A) 112
  (B) 137
  (C) 162.3
  (D) 187

part 3: (C) 162.3

Please note that the actual values for the correct answer and incorrect options should be calculated based on the precise average obtained from the dataset provided. The values given here are hypothetical and used for illustrative purposes only.
