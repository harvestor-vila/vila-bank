# VILA Bank

The VILA bank is a collection of approximately 1,100 high-quality, multiple-choice visualization items designed to assess individuals' ability to perform various visualization tasks. It was generated using a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to create items across 12 different chart types and 13 visualization tasks. The VILA bank supports research and education in visualization literacy, providing a diverse set of questions suitable for repeated testing of the same skills in participants. The items were curated with input from 11 visualization experts and validated using an evaluation rulebook. Additionally, the VILA bank was used to create the VILA-VLAT, a visualization literacy test with demonstrated validity. This resource is available for practical use and further research applications in visualization literacy and assessment.
